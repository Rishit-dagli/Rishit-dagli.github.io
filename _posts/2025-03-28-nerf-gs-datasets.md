The data required for training NeRFs and Gaussian Splats is often much smaller than what used to be required for doing 3D reconstruction. There are quite quite a few formats for the per-scene datasets for training these methods. I often had problems on training such radiance fields on multiple datasets while working on any training, thus I share a collection of 3D reconstruction scenes gathered from various sources, each accompanied by a pre-trained Gaussian Splat model.

Each scene in the dataset usually includes:

- Multi-view image sequences with camera parameters
- Calibration information
- A pre-trained Gaussian Splat model optimized for the scene
